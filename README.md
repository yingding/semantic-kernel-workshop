# Semantic Kernel Workshop

A hands-on workshop exploring Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework for building intelligent AI applications. This workshop provides practical experience with real-world AI application patterns using Python and Azure OpenAI.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop takes you from foundational concepts to advanced implementation patterns through a series of Jupyter notebooks and practical examples. You'll learn how to:

- Build AI applications using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework
- Create and orchestrate AI agents with different capabilities and roles
- Construct structured AI workflows using the Process Framework
- Implement enterprise-ready AI features with security and scalability in mind

## Interactive Playground Demo

Experience Semantic Kernel in action through our interactive playground! This visual demonstration allows you to directly engage with the core concepts covered in the workshop.

The playground offers a hands-on environment where you can:
- Test semantic functions in real-time
- Explore agent capabilities and interactions
- Experiment with memory and embeddings
- Try out native plugin integration
- See the Process Framework in action

No need to wait until the end of the workshop - you can start exploring the playground at any time to reinforce concepts as you learn them!

For setup instructions and details on how to run the playground, refer to the [Playground README](playground/README.md).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Azure OpenAI API access (API key, endpoint, and deployment name)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of prompt engineering concepts (helpful but not required)
- [UV package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Local Dependencies Setup

The project is managed by pyproject.toml and [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

For local execution init the .venv environment using [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```shell
uv sync --prerelease=allow
. ./.venv/bin/activate
```
>OBS! At the time of writing the workshop depends on the prerelease libraries.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Create a virtual environment:
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```cmd
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Copy the environment variables template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Add your Azure OpenAI credentials to the `.env` file:
   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key 
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-azure-endpoint
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=your-embedding-deployment
   ```

5. Start with the first notebook:
   - Begin with `01-intro-to-semantic-kernel/01-intro.ipynb`, which includes instructions for installing Semantic Kernel and other required packages.
